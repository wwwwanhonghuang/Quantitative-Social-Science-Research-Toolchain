# Literature Review Guide for Quantitative Social Science Research

This guide provides a structured workflow and organization framework for conducting and writing a literature review, especially in domains using surveys, quantitative methods, and complex designs.

---

## 1. Define Scope and Objectives

- **Research question(s):**
  - What exactly do you want to learn?
  - Example: “How have complex survey methods been applied in political polling?”
- **Inclusion / Exclusion Criteria:**
  - Time period, methodology, population, domain
- **Type of Review:**
  - Narrative, Systematic, Meta-analysis

---

## 2. Search and Collect Sources

- **Databases:** Google Scholar, Web of Science, Scopus, JSTOR, SSRN, arXiv, Crossref, OSF, socarXiv, Zenodo

- **Keywords / Boolean operators:** `"complex survey" AND "political polling" AND "regression"`
- **Snowballing:**  
  - References in key papers  
  - Citing papers
- **Organization:**  
  - Reference managers: Zotero, Mendeley, EndNote
  - Tag by methodology, population, or findings

---

## 3. Screen and Evaluate Studies

- **Title & Abstract screening**
- **Full-text screening**
- **Assess quality:**  
  - Sample size, methodological rigor, weighting, stratification, clusters, relevance

---

## 4. Extract Key Information

Create a table or spreadsheet:

| Author | Year | Research Question | Population / Sample | Methods | Key Findings | Notes / Trends |
|--------|------|-----------------|------------------|--------|-------------|----------------|

- Include effect sizes, regression coefficients, or survey adjustments when available

---

## 5. Organize Literature Review in Paper

### **A. Research Questions**
- Identify common questions in your domain
- Categorize by themes
- Track evolution over time
- Optional: timeline or network visualization

### **B. Methods / Data & Analysis**
- Statistical and computational methods
- Survey design handling (weights, strata, clusters)
- Evolution of methods over time

### **C. Populations / Contexts**
- Frequently studied populations or regions
- Underrepresented groups

### **D. Findings / Patterns**
- Main empirical findings
- Consistencies and contradictions
- Effect sizes or trends

### **E. Gaps / Opportunities**
- Open research questions
- Methodological limitations
- Opportunities for innovation

---

## 6. Write the Review

- **Introduction:** Motivation, scope, significance
- **Body:** Organized by theme, methodology, or chronology
- **Tables / Figures:** Summarize key information
- **Synthesis / Conclusion:** Gaps and how your research addresses them

---

## 7. Optional Tools and Tips

- Reference manager for organization
- Python / Excel to track papers and extract structured data
- Visualizations: timelines, concept maps, network diagrams
- PRISMA flow diagram for systematic reviews
